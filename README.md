# Fuel_Efficiency-Regression-Prediction
Our focus in this project was on identifying the critical automotive characteristics that significantly impact fuel efficiency. We ensured data integrity through efficient handling of outliers and missing values. Using exploratory data analysis, we revealed patterns and correlations within the dataset, which informed the selection of relevant features for our prediction model. We assessed several machine learning methods, emphasizing their accuracy and consistency in predicting fuel economy. Additionally, we used Power BI to generate interactive visuals that elucidated the connections between various features and fuel economy, making the data insights more accessible and engaging.
